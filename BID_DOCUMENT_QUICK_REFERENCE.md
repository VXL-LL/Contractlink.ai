3. **Ensure text is readable** (not scanned images)

### When Asking Questions:
1. **Be specific** about which document: "my RFP" or "my coversheet"
2. **Reference sections** when possible: "Section 3.2" or "Page 5"
3. **Ask one question at a time** for clearest answers

### Document Organization:
1. **Upload all related documents** (RFP + addendums)
2. **Delete old versions** when requirements change
3. **Re-upload** if documents are significantly updated

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Upload Fails
- **Check file size** (must be under 10 MB)
- **Verify file type** (only PDF, DOCX, TXT)
- **Try different file** to rule out corruption
- **Refresh page** and try again

### AI Doesn't Use Document
- **Use trigger keywords:** "my RFP", "uploaded document", "help me with"
- **Verify upload succeeded** (document appears in list)
- **Be specific** about which document to reference

### Can't See Uploaded Documents
- **Check if logged in** (required for document access)
- **Refresh page** to reload document list
- **Try uploading again** if document missing
